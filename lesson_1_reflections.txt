What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro: you can control each commit, you can do it as your consider it's small, big or logical
Cons: you can forget to do it and increase the size of the commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git if made for projects where each doc is relationated logically with other docs, and googleDocs is made to save changes of single docs
